# Student Performance Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts **student exam scores** using regression models based on study and sleep habits.

## Dataset
The dataset contains student behavior and performance features such as:
- Hours_Studied: Number of hours a student studies daily
- Sleep_Hours: Number of hours a student sleeps daily

**Target:** Exam_Score (student's exam score)

## Workflow
1. Load the dataset
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
3. Feature selection
4. Model training using Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression
5. Model evaluation using R² Score and RMSE
6. Comparison of model performance

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression (degree 2)

## Evaluation Metrics
- R² Score
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## Visualizations
- Scatter plot of Hours Studied vs Exam Score
- Bar plots comparing R² Score and RMSE of different models
