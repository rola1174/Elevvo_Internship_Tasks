# Elevvo Internship Tasks

## Overview
This repository contains the projects completed during my **Elevvo Internship**, where I worked on multiple real-world Machine Learning and Data Analysis tasks.  
The internship focused on applying data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, evaluation, and optimization techniques using Python.
